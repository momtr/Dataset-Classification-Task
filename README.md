# Dataset-Classification-Task
Test for KNN and Naive Bayes Classifiers

## Task
We have a dataset containing the columns `age`, `interest` and `success` (if the customer bought the product):

```
age,interest,success
23.657800719276743,18.859916797201468,0.0
22.573729142097473,17.96922325097786,0.0

Data was split into training (75%) and testing (25%) data. 

## Scores

The k-Nearest Neighbors classifier had a score of 98% and the Naive Bayes classifier had a score of 86% (same training and testing data).
